# Python Async Function Project

This project contains tasks related to asynchronous programming in Python using `asyncio`. The tasks involve creating async functions, executing multiple coroutines, measuring runtime, and working with asyncio.Tasks.

## Tasks

1. **The basics of async**: Write an asynchronous coroutine that waits for a random delay and returns it.
2. **Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async**: Execute multiple coroutines concurrently and return their results in ascending order.
3. **Measure the runtime**: Measure the runtime of executing multiple coroutines.
4. **Tasks**: Create an asyncio.Task from an async function.
5. **Tasks**: Modify a function to use asyncio.Task.
